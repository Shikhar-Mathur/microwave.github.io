                        Microwave ovens work on the principle of conversion of electromagnetic energy into thermal energy. Electromagnetic (EM) energy refers to the radiation comprising an electrical field and magnetic field oscillating perpendicular to each other. When a polar molecule falls in the path of these EM radiations, it oscillates to align with them. This causes the energy to be lost from the dipole by molecular friction and collision, resulting in heating. Microwaves are electromagnetic radiations with frequencies between 300MHz (0.3 GHz) and 300 GHz, and the corresponding wavelengths ranging from 0.9m to .0009m.

             <ul>
            <li>After the generation of microwaves at the magnetron, they are guided by the waveguide towards the media inside the cavity.  </li> <br> 
            <li>The microwaves penetrate through the surface of the food and liquid  media and reach the water molecules present inside it. </li> <br>
            <li>As the orientation of the electric field changes over time, the polar molecules of water attempt to follow the field by changing their orientation inside the material to line up along the field lines in an energetically favourable configuration .</li> <br>
            <li>As these molecules change direction rapidly ,they gain energy, which increases the temperature of the material. This process is called dielectric heating. </li> <br>
            <li>The microwave energy diminishes according to the inverse square law, and therefore, the cavity chamber, where we place food, liquid media etc. is designed in such a way that it carries out the maximum efficiency of the heating effect of microwaves.</li><br>

                <ul>
                    <li> A microwave oven should not be operated with an open, bent, or broken door.</li> <br>
                    <li> To avoid any mishappening, it is recommended not to stand directly in front of a microwave oven while it is operating.  </li> <br>
                    <li> The liquids should not be heated longer than the recommended temperature as it can cause the water vapors to reach the electric components and interfere with their working. </li> <br>
                    <li> It is essential to periodically clean the cavity with water and mild detergent. It is recommended to not use scouring pads, steel wool, or other abrasives for the cleaning process. </li> <br>
